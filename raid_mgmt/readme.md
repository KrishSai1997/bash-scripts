# Raid Management Tools
Collection of scripts that attempt to protect data and drive loss on RAID systems. Designed for `raid6` using `mdadm` but will likely function well with other raid levels.

# Usage
1. Download a script via `wget https://github.com/humor4fun/bash-scripts/new/master/raid_mgmt/script.sh -O script.sh`
2. Add execution bit via `chmod +x script.sh` 
3. Install them to `/etc/rc.local` or your other job scheduler
